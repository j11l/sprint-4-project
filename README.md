# sprint-4-project

This is a simple data visualization exercise, demonstrating use of Plotly Express graphs in a Streamlit web app.

It is written in Python 3.11.7, and depends on the streamlit, pandas, plotly.express, and altair libraries.

With streamlit and the other required dependencies installed in a command-line Python environment, this app can be run in Streamlit with `streamlit run app.py`, which should direct you to 0.0.0.0:10000 to view it in a browser.
